- Hi, I'm Joba! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate digital creator and social media strategist with expertise in web3, NFTs, and blockchain technology. With a background in managing and growing online communities, I bring a unique perspective to content creation, strategy, and engagement within the degen and creator economy.

On this profile, youâ€™ll find projects and collaborations reflecting my interests in blockchain, NFTs, and decentralized platforms. I'm always exploring new tools and trends to stay ahead in the fast-evolving world of web3.
